SQLDelight generates typesafe Kotlin APIs from your SQL statements. It verifies your schema, statements, and migrations at compile-time and provides IDE features like autocomplete and refactoring which make writing and maintaining SQL simple.

SQLDelight understands your existing SQL schema.

```sql
CREATE TABLE hockey_player (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  number INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

It generates typesafe code for any labeled SQL statements.
